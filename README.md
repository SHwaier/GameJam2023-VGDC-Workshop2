# GameJam2023 VGDC Workshop 2
All the resources needed to follow along with the VGDC workshop to prepare you for the game creation week.

If you didn't attend the first workshop last week, then I recommend you watching it on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDqZeUNCV5s">youtube channel</a>

Note: we are using different packages for this workshop, so do make sure to install them ahead of time so you can get the same results as the workshop.



## Todo
1.1) Make sure you have unity 2021 or higher installed on your machine, if not install the latest version so you don't run into any compatibility issues;
1.2) Create a unity account if you haven't already;
2) Create a new empty Unity project, with the "3d core" template;
3) Open the <a href="https://github.com/SHwaier/GameJam2023-VGDC-Workshop2/blob/main/Packages.md">packages</a> file in the repo and follow the links to add each asset to your unity project, 3 packages in total;
4) Download all the images from this repo, and add them to your asset folder;
5) Tune in to the workshop on our <a href="https://discord.gg/6BJMVyyk">Discord Server</a> at 6pm for the fun!!!!

If you have any trouble with any of the steps above, we'll help you during the workshop.
